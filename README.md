# Healthcare Data Analysis

This project analyzes healthcare data to extract insights into patient experiences, operational efficiency, and demographic trends. The dataset includes patient information, appointment details, and department referrals. This README outlines the key metrics calculated, the analysis conducted, and the data structure used.

## Key Metrics and Analysis

1. **Average Wait Time**
   - **Description:** Discover how long patients typically wait before their appointments. Uncover patterns and trends that shed light on the efficiency of our healthcare system.
   - **Purpose:** Understand the efficiency of the appointment scheduling process and identify bottlenecks.

2. **Patient Satisfaction**
   - **Description:** Explore the average satisfaction scores given by our patients. Learn about the factors that contribute to a positive patient experience and how we can enhance it.
   - **Purpose:** Measure patient satisfaction and identify areas for improvement in service delivery.

3. **Total Patient Visits Monthly**
   - **Description:** Get an overview of the ebb and flow of patients through our doors each month. Understand the dynamics of healthcare demand over time.
   - **Purpose:** Analyze patient visit trends to better manage resources and staff.

4. **Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments**
   - **Description:** Delve into the data to distinguish between appointments that involve administrative processes and those that don't. Explore the impact on wait times and patient satisfaction.
   - **Purpose:** Evaluate the impact of administrative tasks on the patient experience.

5. **Referrals and Walk-In Patients**
   - **Description:** Uncover the balance between patients referred to specific departments and those who walk in without prior referral. How does this impact the overall patient experience?
   - **Purpose:** Understand the dynamics of patient flow and its effect on department workload.

6. **Patient Visits by Age Group and Race**
   - **Description:** Explore the distribution of patient visits across different age groups and races. Gain insights into the diversity of healthcare needs and preferences.
   - **Purpose:** Identify demographic trends and potential disparities in healthcare access.
